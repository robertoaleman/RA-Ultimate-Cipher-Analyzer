# RA Ultimate Cipher Analyzer
RA Ultimate Cipher Analyzer is a web-based tool designed to analyze encrypted files and suggest the encryption algorithm used based on statistical heuristic analysis and known patterns. 


RA Ultimate Cipher Analyzer is a web-based tool designed to analyze encrypted files and suggest the encryption algorithm used based on statistical properties and known patterns. It calculates metrics such as entropy, byte distribution (chi-square test), and file size to identify characteristics of strong ciphers (e.g., AES, RSA) and weak ciphers (e.g., Caesar). The tool detects specific patterns associated with common encryption formats (e.g., OpenSSL, PGP/GPG) and handles Base64-encoded data, making it suitable for both binary and encoded files.

The tool provides a user-friendly interface for uploading files and displays detailed analysis results, including a table of expected entropy values for various ciphers. It is implemented as a PHP class (RA_UltimateCipherAnalyzer) for modularity and extensibility, making it ideal for cybersecurity professionals, developers, and researchers.
